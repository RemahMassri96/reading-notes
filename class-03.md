# Reading Notes ( Class 03) :

**HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow**

- Ordered lists : are lists where each item in the list is numbered.
- Unordered lists : are lists that begin with a bullet point.
-  Definition lists : are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
- Lists can be nested inside one another.
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box
- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
- You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS 
- It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
 - Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
 - Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
 - CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.
 
- Comparison operators return single values of true of false.
- Logical operators allow you to compare the results of mre than comparison operator 

**IF ... ELSE** :
- There is no need to provide an else option. (You can just use an if statement.)
- With a series of if statements, they are all checked even if a match has been found
(so it performs more slowly than switch).

**SWITCH** :
- You have a default option that is run if none of the cases match.
- If a match is found, that code is run; then the break statement stops the rest of the switch statement running (providing
better performance than multiple i f
statements).
