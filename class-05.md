A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.

- The <img> element is used to add images to a web page.
Images should... 
- Be relevant
- Convey information
- Convey the right mood
- Be instantly recognisable'
- Fit the color palette

- The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page.
- Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent. Vector images are commonly created in programs such as Adobe Illustrator.
- Animated GIFs show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.
- You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image.
- You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format
- Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.
- Color can really bring your pages to life.
- The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
1.rgb values :
These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)
2. hex codes :
These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80
3. color names:
There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan

- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names
- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
-  There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.
- There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed
- If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.
 - You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented- 
-  You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
