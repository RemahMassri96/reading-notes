The language for building web pages , HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages.

With HTML you can create your own Website.
- An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
- All HTML elements can have attributes
- Attributes provide additional information about elements
- Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
- HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.
- A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.
-The HTML style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
- to add a comment in html we use this <! – comment here – >
- id attribute is used to give an element a special id.
- class attribute is used to make several elements in the page different.
- < iframes > cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
- The <meta> element lives inside the <head> element and contains information about that web page.
- the description contains a description of the page. This description is commonly used by search engines to understand what the page is about and should be a maximum of 155 characters.
   - The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
   - Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.
   - The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
   - The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
   - Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
   - To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.
   - It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return
   - Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
   - Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
   - Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
   -  You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
   - You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.
