# Reading Notes ( HTML Tables; JS Constructor Functions) ::
- A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results.

-  The <table> element is used to add tables to a web page.
  - A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the `<tr>` element.
  - Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the `<td>` element (or `<th>` if it is a
header).
  -  You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
  - For long tables you can split the table into a <thead> , <tbody> , and <tfoot> .
  - An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you .
  - In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.
  - Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window
  
  - JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
     methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
     - Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
